# Compiler Base Plugin for Gradle

This is a base plugin for anyone who cares to implement a compiler. If you want to do that, it's presumed that you know enough to 
figure out how this plugin works.  If you need help figuring it out or would like some other help, feel free to contact 
[Robert Fischer](http://github.com/RobertFischer/) for consulting support.

## TODOs 

* Provide support for "compilers" which generate code, with a special case for compilers which generate Java code. (Think JJTree and Javacc.)
